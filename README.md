        Young's Double Slit Experiment (YDSE) on Qiskit

This project simulates the classic Young's Double Slit Experiment using IBM's Qiskit framework to demonstrate quantum superposition and interference.

Overview

Young’s Double Slit Experiment (YDSE) is a fundamental demonstration of the wave-particle duality of photons. This quantum simulation models the behavior of single photons passing through two slits and interfering, creating a distribution pattern on a detection screen. Using Qiskit, we replicate the experiment by representing slits with quantum superposition,modeling interference through quantum gates,simulating photon hits on a screen,visualizing the resulting interference pattern.

Concepts Covered

1. Quantum superposition and interference
2.Probabilistic measurement outcomes
3.Quantum circuit modeling
4.Visualization of quantum behavior

Features

1. Easy-to-understand quantum circuit design
2.Customizable number of shots (photon simulations)
3.Histogram visualization of interference
4.Theoretical explanations included
